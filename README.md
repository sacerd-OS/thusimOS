# thusimos
[θύσιμος](https://lsj.gr/wiki/θύσιμος) is a rare Greek word meaning "worthy of sacrifice." ThusimOS is a toy kernel that I am writing as the final project for COMPSCI377. It is named because I am prepared to sacrifice my grade for doing such a hard project.

The idea behind thusimOS is a hackathon kernel -- ie. it is the result of the question "how much of a kernel can I write in a few days?" I find *time* to be the only reasonable way to scope a project as vast as a kernel. Otherwise, it's very easy to get lost in the sauce of what a kernel entails: I need better multithreading, a more secure filesystem...

## Why a kernel?
Because I fucking love operating systems and need to write kernels to sustain myself. Modifying someone else's kernel doesn't cut it, and I can't do dumb Greek puns if I fix xv6.

## Resources used?
Sure:
- **[OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)** - Useful for theoretical grounding in UNIX based OS
- **[OSDev](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page)** - Good resource for OS development, but the users are annoying Linux bros.
- **[OSDev Book](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf)** - Extremely amazing resource for OSdev.
